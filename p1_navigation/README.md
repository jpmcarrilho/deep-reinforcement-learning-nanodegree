# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

#### Environment

In this project an agent was trained to navigate and collect bananas in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Installation

For executing the codes in this project you will need a Python3.5+ interpreter and other dependencies installed, according to your OS:
1. Install Anaconda©: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html#
2. Initiate a conda environment with Python 3.5+	
3. Instal the following packages and their dependencies:
	- numpy: https://scipy.org/install.html
	- matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html
	- PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
	- Unity ML: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md

4. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

### Running the code

After all packages have been installed in the environment you should open Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda find and open `Navigation.iypnb` archive. To run the cells you can simply click on the first one and press `Shift + Enter`. This can be made through the whole Notebook.
